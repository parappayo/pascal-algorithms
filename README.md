Messing around with algorithms using FreePascal.

## But why?

I've always had a bit of a soft spot for Pascal and its various dialects. When I was an undergrad I did a lot of lab assignments in Borland [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) and later did some of my first paid dev work in [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)) and [C++Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder). This legacy lives on through projects like [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) and [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

My library of Pascal books has long since been scattered to the winds, but one book I held on to was Herb Schildt's Advanced Modula-2 (McGraw Hill, 1987), which has the advantages of being light in form factor, giving some concise history of the Pascal language (up until the mid-80s at least), and mostly being an introductory algorithms book that just happens to have examples in Modula-2. It is by now a crazily obscure book, but I am inspired to capture some learnings from it.

Is it a pain to work with compared to Python or C? Absolutely.

## Conversions from Modula-2 to FreePascal

* FreePascal is case insensitive
* `begin` keyword added to the start of scope blocks
* `cardinal` type replaced with `uint32`
* `for ... by -1` replaced with `downto`
